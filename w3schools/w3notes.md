- SCOPING
  - Big difference from JS: function closures don't have access to containing scope. As in, totally closed off scope, not 1-way
  - 3 scopes
    - global: outside of any function
    - local: within a function
    - static: carried over from function to function

- "PHP code are executed on the server, and the result is returned to the browser as plain HTML"
  - HYPERTEXT PREPROCESSOR
  - PHP's main job is to church up HMTL docs before sending them down to the client
  - by doing so in PHP, on the server, the client can't expect your churching,
  how you're manipulating the files

- functions are NOT case-sensitive


- Variable restrictions
  - variables ARE case-sensitive
  - only alphanumeric characters and underscores; NO DASHES
  - can't start with a number
  - starts w/ $
