# QUESTIONS

- What's the difference between using PHP's built-in server and the Apache server that comes
with Macs? Pros and cons?

- "Note: Unlike other programming languages, PHP has no command for declaring a variable. It is created the moment you first assign a value to it." ( https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_variables.asp )
   - WHAT???


# INTERESTING NOTES

- "If a file is pure PHP code, it is preferable to omit the PHP closing tag at the end of the file. This prevents accidental whitespace or new lines being added after the PHP closing tag, which may cause unwanted effects because PHP will start output buffering when there is no intention from the programmer to send any output at that point in the script." (http://php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.phptags.php)

# SERVER

- Note on PHP server logging "unexpected E0F errors" on file execution

# Differences from JS

- Closure! Not one way, totally closed off
- Classical, not prototypal inheritance?
- xor operator
   - How useful is this? Why isn't this in JS?
